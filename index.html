        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>I love to create simple yet good looking websites. I always love making webpages. All started when I first learn some basic HTML and CSS during my HS exam. I started making webpages using HTML and CSS since then. I really love what I made then even though it wasn't really good looking. I can make way better websites now but I'm still learning because I wan't to make even better sites which are beautiful, simple and more functional.</p>

        <h3>Programing</h3>
        <p>I love coding as much as I love designing webpages. I can make stuff using Java, C#. I first learn coding during HS where I learn coding in C. Now Why I learn HTML, CSS, C all during my HS? Well I took Computer Science as my 4th subject because I wanted to know about Computer, The mechine I love.  I think a lot of people starts from C, right? I then learn java in college. I like coding in java more than C#. I'm still learning different java frameworks. Coding is really fun.</p>

        <h3>Listening Music</h3>
        <p>I love different types of music. I don't like Rap much unless it's a Nightcore or Anime OST. When people ask me what song you are listening, most of the time I just said some random bengali song's name or hindi or english. Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't like those. I actually like bengali, hindi songs but not love it. What I love to listen is Anime OST and Nightcore. 70% of the time it's Fairy Tail OSTs (My favourite anime), Bleach OSTs and Nightcore. Rest of the time some other music depeding on my mood.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>I love playing PC games since my childhood. I first play IGI on PC. Then IGI 2, GTA Vice City etc. After that I found the Battlefield series and Call of Duty series. I still love the old COD1 and COD2 games but Battlefield's multuiplayer is on a different level. I was stunned when I first played Battlefield Bad Complany 2's multiplayer. 16 vs 16 instead of COD's usual 6 vs 6. Way bigger maps, excellent destruction, better gunplay and movement than COD. Everything was ahead of it's time. The capabilites of the new Frostbite engine was amazing. Which made Battlefield so awesome. I love playing Battlefield series. No other game can match the multiplayer experience of Battlefield series. I'm really excited about the next Battlefield game, which is gonna release this year (around October or November 2021). I also play other games like Assassin's Creed series, Prince of Persia series. I really love PoP. Hope to see a new PoP game. I also play other FPS game like Medal of Honors. BR game like PUBG, COD Warzone. I like mobile games also. Pokemon Go is my favourite mobile game. Other than that I play Asphalt, COD Mobile, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale. Ok I slould stop now. Everyone can already get the point that for me Game is love, Game is life.</p>
